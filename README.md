Durham Hoods
============

Durham, North Carolina neighborhoods mapped out in GeoJSON.<br>
This map is the underlying feature of my DurhamHoods project.<br>
All borders were hand-drawn and sourced from digital Durham communities or via input from the community.

You can view the map and its code [here](https://github.com/PhillipBost/durham-hoods-geojson/blob/master/durham-hoods.geojson).<br>
[Historical changes](https://github.com/PhillipBost/durham-hoods-geojson/blob/master/History.md) to the map and [future plans](https://github.com/PhillipBost/durham-hoods-geojson/blob/master/Future.md) are also available.
